# odin-recipes

This is the first project of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. It is a very simple HTML project to create a page of recipes demonstrating a knowledge of the following:

1. Elements & Tags
2. HTML Boilerplate
3. Working with text
4. Working with Lists (Ordered & Unordered)
5. Links & Images
6. Titles
7. Commit Messages

It is not designed to be elegant, but to demonstrate basic structure practices. CSS Foundations is to follow :)
