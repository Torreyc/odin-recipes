    <h2>A gluten-free way to enjoy Philly Cheesesteak!</h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Olive Oil</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Fresh Garlic</li>
      <li>Bell Peppers</li>
      <li>Baby Bella Mushrooms</li>
      <li>Sliced Provolone</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season and Cook the Steak: Season the steak well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet (cast iron skillet is good, but regular is fine, too). Saute the steak for 1-2 minutes per side. To avoid crowding the pan, you may have to work in batches. Remove the steak to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season and Cook the Vegetables: Drain off any liquid from the pan; heat the remaining oil, and add the vegetables, garlic, and Italian Seasoning. Cook until the veggies are soft.</li>
        <li>Return Steak to Pan and Top with Cheese: Add the cooked steak back to the pan and continue cooking for a minute to heat through. Taste for salt, and then place sliced Provolone on top of the mixture. Allow the cheese to melt.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Sprinkle the chopped parsley and green onions over the dish. Enjoy!</li>
